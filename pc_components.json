It entirely relieves the memory module's transmission and provides gamers with the greatest overclocking feeling as well as a very stable overclocking memory module. It is plug and plays ready. Overclocking can be super easy without the hassle of manually adjusting the BIOS. It is compatible with both Intel & AMD platforms, therefore gamers can easily enjoy overclocking without worries. With a low working voltage of 1.2~1.4V from DDR4 DELTA RGB, it is not only energy saving but can also reduce the temperature and the heat generated to offer the high-speed running memory a stable and long time operation. Multiple compatibility checks with common DDR4 motherboards to ensure stability with all QVL motherboards (Qualified Vendor List). The ideal combination's aesthetic design neatly represents a pair of soaring wings. They reflect the ability of TEAMGROUP's high-quality and extreme-performance gaming goods to allow all gamers to surpass the speed limit and enjoy the ever-changing world of gaming. The TEAM T-Force DELTA RGB White 16GB 3200MHz DDR4 CL16 RAM comes with a lifetime warranty.",
